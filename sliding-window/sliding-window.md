# Sliding Window Algorithms

The idea of the sliding window is to focus on a segment of a continuous data set. Since we constantly ignore most parts of the dataset, the sliding window algorithms can be very fast, usually come with time complexity of O(n). 

A sliding window, by its nature, is a double-ended queue (deque). Try to use data structures like deque and stack to optimize the performance. Nested loops usually result in unacceptably wasting of time for this kind of problem.
