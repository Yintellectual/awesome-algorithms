# Awesome Algorithms ðŸš€
This repository contains a collection of challenging algorithms that I've worked through and explained in detail, with corresponding Python implementations.

### Commit Message Conventions
To maintain a clean and consistent commit history, please follow these conventions for commit messages:

1. **Format**: Use the following format for commit messages:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <subject>
   ```

2. **Types**:
   - `feat`: A new feature
   - `fix`: A bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation changes
   - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
   - `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes, no bug fixes)
   - `test`: Adding or updating tests
   - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

3. **Scope**: The scope should be the name of the module or file that the commit affects.

4. **Subject**: A brief description of the changes. Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").

#### Examples
- `feat(sliding-window): Add max of minimums algorithm`
- `fix(max_of_minimums.py): Fix boundary calculation bug`
- `docs: Update README with commit message conventions`

By following these conventions, we can ensure that our commit history is easy to read and understand.
